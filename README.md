# Bouncing-Ball
Implementation of a ball with bouncing physics using the StdDraw library.

Physics have been implemented based on velocity, gravitational acceleration and other factors such as elasticity of the ball.

It is still a work in progress. I will update and improve it further.

# Things to improve on
- Collision detection with other balls
- Surface collision: e.g a line in the middle of the canvas
- Usage of mouse acceleration so it is possible to shoot the ball with the mouse
